        <h1><a>About us</a></h1>
        <p>We started making game 12 of April 2019. Our first mobile game still in process of development,
            but we would make  new games for our fans. Also games we make ,are for people ,without model of playing ‘pay- to-win’ and etc. All guys with who we works are from Ukraine and also we really like playing games and our team know how to impress fans by new interesting game moments.
            But for us the best way to show your thanks are to share our games with your friends or members of yours family.
